# Joe's Standup Timer (joes-standup-timer)

Simple standup helper to track talking time of attendants.

See the deployed application on my Github Pages: https://rustyjoem.github.io/standup-timer

This is a client side single page app, no requests to external APIs are being done. <br/>
No backend running on server, all is happening in the end-users's browser. <br/>
Local storage is used to save meeting templates, no cookies involved.
